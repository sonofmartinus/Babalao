# BABALAO

## Origin of word

> Babaaláwo or Babalawo in West Africa (Babalao in Caribbean and South American Spanish and Babalaô in Brazilian Portuguese) literally means "father of secrets" in the Yoruba language. It is a spiritual title that denotes a high priest of the Ifá oracle. Ifá is a divination system  that represents the teachings of the Òrìṣà Ọrunmila, the Òrìṣà of Wisdom, who in turn serves as the oracular representative of Olodumare.  

This is the repository for my current gaming/dev workstation. After many years without having built my own PC. 
I decided it was time to build a new system to satisfy my gaming needs and my recently discovered scripting needs.  
Please take a look at the 'babalao' markdown file to inspect hardware specs.  
Feel free to comment or ask any questions in regards.
